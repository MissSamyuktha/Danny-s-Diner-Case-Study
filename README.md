2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?

###  1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?

```sql
SELECT

#### Had the customer joined the loyalty program before making the purchases, total points that each customer would have accrued
```sql
SELECT
    customer_id,
    SUM(CASE
        WHEN product_name <> 'sushi' THEN price * 10

###  10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January

```sql
SELECT
    sales.customer_id,
    SUM(CASE
        WHEN order_date >= join_date AND 
            order_date < (join_date + INTERVAL '7 days')

###  Bonus Questions

#### Join All The Things
Create basic data tables that Danny and his team can use to quickly derive insights without needing to join the underlying tables using SQL. Fill Member column as 'N' if the purchase was made before becoming a member and 'Y' if the after is amde after joining the membership.

```sql
CREATE TABLE diner AS
    SELECT
        sales.customer_id,
        order_date,
        product_name,
        price,
        CASE
            WHEN order_date >= join_date AND 
            sales.customer_id = members.customer_id THEN 'Y'
            ELSE 'N'
        END AS member
    FROM
        sales
    LEFT JOIN
        members ON sales.customer_id = members.customer_id
    LEFT JOIN
        menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id

/* if CTE   ORDER BY
                sales.customer_id,
                order_date,
                price DESC
``` 
	
#### Result set:
| Customer ID | Order Date  | Product Name | Price | Member |
|------------|------------|--------------|-------|--------|
| A          | 2021-01-01 | Curry        | 15    | N      |
| A          | 2021-01-01 | Sushi        | 10    | N      |
| A          | 2021-01-07 | Curry        | 15    | Y      |
| A          | 2021-01-10 | Ramen        | 12    | Y      |
| A          | 2021-01-11 | Ramen        | 12    | Y      |
| A          | 2021-01-11 | Ramen        | 12    | Y      |

#### Rank All The Things
Danny also requires further information about the ranking of customer products, but he purposely does not need the ranking for non-member purchases so he expects null ranking values for the records when customers are not yet part of the loyalty program.
#### Steps
Create a member_diner table using the diner table created in above queries with rankings where customer is member.   
Select * and null as rankings from diner table where customer is not member.   
UNION ALL to combine tables.   

```sql
WITH member_diner AS (
    SELECT *,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER(
                    PARTITION BY customer_id 
                    ORDER BY order_date, price DESC)
            AS ranking
    FROM diner
    WHERE
        member = 'Y'
)

SELECT *,
    NULL AS ranking
FROM diner
WHERE
    member = 'N'
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM member_diner
ORDER BY customer_id, order_date, price DESC
;
``` 

#### Result set:
| customer_id | order_date  | product_name | price | member | ranking |
|------------|------------|--------------|-------|--------|---------|
| A          | 2021-01-01 | curry        | 15    | N      | NULL    |
| A          | 2021-01-01 | sushi        | 10    | N      | NULL    |
| A          | 2021-01-07 | curry        | 15    | Y      | 1       |
| A          | 2021-01-10 | ramen        | 12    | Y      | 2       |

| A          | 2021-01-11 | ramen        | 12    | Y      | 3       |
| B          | 2021-01-01 | curry        | 15    | N      | NULL    |
| B          | 2021-01-02 | curry        | 15    | N      | NULL    |
| B          | 2021-01-04 | sushi        | 10    | N      | NULL    |
| B          | 2021-01-11 | sushi        | 10    | Y      | 1       |
| B          | 2021-01-16 | ramen        | 12    | Y      | 2       |
| B          | 2021-02-01 | ramen        | 12    | Y      | 3       |
| C          | 2021-01-01 | ramen        | 12    | N      | NULL    |
| C          | 2021-01-01 | ramen        | 12    | N      | NULL    |
| C          | 2021-01-07 | ramen        | 12    | N      | NULL    |
